developement environment

os : windows

    database : sqlite3

    files like speech recognition,assistant, execute, database

os : linux (tesla server)
    language: python

    training and preparing chatbot data on tesla server


Result and discussion ;

    result : speech to text
             search a keyword by opening browser
             open any file

    discussion : response time can be decrease further by implementing sppech recognition from scratch rather than using it from online
                 enrich dataset to train the chat bot model to increase it`s efficiency
                 training time is more and you should use powerful gpu to run it
                 scanning drive may take time some time

Individual Contribution

    mayank Mahavar (15IT126)  : created chatbot , handled tesla server and database
    munna sah (15IT221)       : created speech recognition(search differnt speech recognition)

Conclusion and Future Work

    automation of programs. searching anything on browser, open any file from voice ,
    chat with your assistant(interaction)

    in future question and answer algorithm to use it as the memory of the assistant
    sending mail
